# Micromaps
This project creates a micromap plot using the R package micromapST. The data used for the analysis is the csv file ACS07and17edited.csv, which
contains estimates and associated margins of error for the number of veterans in each U.S. state in 2007 and in 2017.
These estimates and margins of error were computed by the U.S. Census Bureau from survey data that the Bureau collected in its American Community Survey. The
2007 estimates are based on three years of ACS data for 2005-2007. The 2017 estimates are based on five-years of ACS data for 2013-2017.
The csv file contains 51 data records and 14 variables. 

R script produces the micromap plot in the file VeteransMicroMap5.pdf
